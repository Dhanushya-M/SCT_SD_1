# 🌡️ Temperature Converter – Task 01

This repository contains the solution to **Task 01** from my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**. The project focuses on developing a responsive temperature converter using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, allowing users to convert temperatures between **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin**.

---

## 🧾 Introduction

Temperature conversion is a fundamental task often required in science, weather forecasting, education, and engineering. This project aims to create a lightweight, real-time converter with an interactive and responsive UI that performs accurate conversions between three commonly used temperature scales.

---

## 📌 Description

The web application allows users to input a value in any one of the temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and it instantly calculates and displays the equivalent values in the other two units. The application is implemented using **vanilla JavaScript** for the logic, and styled using **CSS** to ensure a clean and user-friendly experience.

This task helped solidify my understanding of basic mathematical operations in JavaScript, event-driven programming, and responsive design principles.

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

- Practiced DOM manipulation using JavaScript
  
- Understood temperature conversion formulas:
  
  - °C = (°F − 32) × 5⁄9
  - °F = (°C × 9⁄5) + 32
  - K = °C + 273.15
    
- Built a mobile-friendly interface with responsive CSS
  
- Strengthened skills in organizing code and using Git/GitHub for version control
